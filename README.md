# Creditcard Bill Separator

>Description

I made this program to assist me in dividing the bill of my credit card with to more people of my family, because they use it to make purchase as well.

The program works by reading my credit card bill in PDF format, extracting the purchases and presenting than to the user so he/she can select which person is going to pay that purchase. After that the program will create one PDF for each person and inside will be every purchase selected for that person, with the total amount that he/she has to pay.
